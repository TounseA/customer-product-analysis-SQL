/*
We can conclude that Vintage cars and motorcycles should be top priority for restoking â€” being the highest-performing products.
The LTV (Customer Lifetime Value), shows us how much profit an average customer generates during their lifetime with the store.
We can use it to predict the stores future profit. 
The current LTV is $39,039. So if theres ten new customers, the store should earn $390,395.
We can use this prediction to decide how much should be spent to aquire new customers.
